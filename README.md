# Merkle Validation Library

This library provides tools, structures, and utilities for Merkle tree validation and operations. I had a good time working on this, so hopefully talk soon. Most of the functions use Result or Option to improve error handling, and deviations from the assignment doc are pointed out if any. Thanks, Ayush.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```
cargo install
```

### Documentation

The best way to understand this library is by generating and viewing the local documentation:

```
cargo doc --open
```

This will generate documentation and automatically open it in your default web browser.

### Testing

To ensure that everything is set up correctly and that the library functions as intended, run

```
cargo test
```
